# RulesEngine
RulesEngine is a lightweight open source framework to develop rules based models using a 
backtracking, generative search mechanism that validates a given set of inputs against 
their applicable rules to find a solution if one exists.

The approach used is based on the concept of backtracking described here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking

Real-world applications of such rules based models include complex product configuration 
problems encountered in computer, telecommunications and aerospace industries.
